          <h2>Our Journey</h2>
          <p>
            Born during HackSpire 2025, FundMyChai started as a passion project fueled by late-night brainstorming 
            and countless cups of chai. What began as a spark has now evolved into a platform that connects ideas 
            with opportunities across the globe.
